## About hygenio-didact

_Using Hygen to create vscode-didact walkthroughs._

link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-didact[vscode-didact] is a VSCode extension that turns VSCode into a walkthough system for cloud-native development. 
It supports adding logic to markdown and asciidoc documents to promote "Docs driven development". 
Imagine a readme that checks and installs dependencies. 
However, the code required to turn your readme into a masterpiece of User Experience is tricky.

link:https://github.com/jondot/hygen/[Hygen] is a cli available from npm that allows you template files driven by YAML, providing a good Author Experience to manipulate the didact code, while enforcing consistency.

The `hygenic didact` is an opinionated convention for writing didact walkthroughs.
Those conventions differ for AsciiDoc versus Markdown.


For AsciiDoc:

1.  Each didact interaction is an include statement referencing a single section from a separate file eg readme-or-blank.adoc
2.  The fragments file is tagged so that the include statement references a specific section

Naming example:

skupper.didact.adoc
skupper-or-blank.adoc
or-blank.adoc


include:{didact}-or-blank.adoc[tags=check-kubectl]

// tag::check-kubectl[]
.. <didact code to check kubectl>
// end::check-kubectl[]
